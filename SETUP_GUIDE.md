# üîß Setup Guide for Urbit AI Analytics

## Step 1: Get Your Llama API Key

1. Go to [Llama API website](https://api.llama.com/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Copy the key for the next step

## Step 2: Configure Your Urbit Ship Connection

### Get Your Session Cookie:

1. **Open your Urbit ship in a web browser** (e.g., http://localhost:8080)
2. **Log in to your ship**
3. **Open browser developer tools** (F12 or Right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
4. **Go to Application/Storage tab**
5. **Find Cookies section**
6. **Look for a cookie like `urbauth-~your-ship`**
7. **Copy the cookie value** (long string of characters)

### Get Your Ship URL:
- If running locally: `http://localhost:8080`
- If running on another machine: `http://SHIP_IP_ADDRESS:8080`
- If using HTTPS: `https://your-ship-domain.com`

## Step 3: Update Configuration

Edit the `.env` file with your actual values:

```bash
# Replace with your actual Llama API key
LLAMA_API_KEY=your_actual_llama_api_key_here

# Replace with your ship's URL
URBIT_SHIP_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Replace with your session cookie
URBIT_SESSION_COOKIE=your_actual_session_cookie_here

# Replace with your ship name (without the ~)
URBIT_RECIPIENT_SHIP=your-ship-name
```

## Step 4: Configure Groups to Monitor

Edit `config.py` and update the MONITORED_GROUPS list:

```python
MONITORED_GROUPS = [
    "/ship/~zod/general-chat",
    "/ship/~sampel-palnet/developer-discussion",
    "/ship/~marzod/announcements",
    # Add more groups here
]
```

## Step 5: Test the Setup

```bash
python3 main.py test
```

## Step 6: Run the System

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## üîç Finding Group Paths

To find group paths in your Urbit ship:

1. **Go to Groups app** in your ship
2. **Click on a group** you want to monitor
3. **Look at the URL** - it will show the group path
4. **Format**: `/ship/~HOST-SHIP/GROUP-NAME`

Example: If you see a group hosted by `~zod` called `general`, the path would be:
`/ship/~zod/general`

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues:
- Make sure your session cookie is current (they expire)
- Check that your ship URL is correct and accessible
- Verify your ship allows external connections

### API Issues:
- Verify your Llama API key is correct
- Check your API quota/credits
- Monitor the logs in `urbit_analytics.log`

### Group Access Issues:
- Make sure you're a member of the groups you're trying to monitor
- Check that group paths are formatted correctly
- Verify groups are active and have recent messages

## üìä Understanding Reports

The system will send reports like this to your ship:

```
ü§ñ **Urbit Network Analytics Report**
üìä Generated: 2024-08-01 15:30:00
üìà Monitoring: 3 groups (2 active)

## Executive Summary  
Moderate activity detected with 45 messages from 12 users.
Technical discussions trending upward.

## Key Insights
- Developer chat most active (67% of messages)
- Positive sentiment (72% positive)
- New topic emerging: "Decentralized social protocols"

## Recommendations
Consider creating dedicated channel for protocol discussions
```

## üîÑ Running Continuously

The system runs continuously and:
- **Monitors groups** every hour (configurable)
- **Sends daily reports** at 9 AM (configurable)
- **Stores data** locally for trend analysis
- **Logs activity** to `urbit_analytics.log`

## üìà Advanced Configuration

You can customize monitoring in `config.py`:

- `ANALYSIS_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: How often to analyze (default: 60)
- `ACTIVITY_LOOKBACK_HOURS`: How far back to look (default: 24)
- `MIN_MESSAGES_FOR_ANALYSIS`: Minimum messages to analyze (default: 5)

## üöÄ Ready to Start!

Once configured, your system will:
1. ‚úÖ Monitor your chosen Urbit groups
2. ‚úÖ Analyze conversations with AI
3. ‚úÖ Send intelligent summaries to your ship
4. ‚úÖ Track trends and patterns over time
5. ‚úÖ Detect anomalies and interesting developments
